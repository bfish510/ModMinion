TODO:
=========

High Priority:
- Scan all comments, even heavily downvoted ones.
- Scan post titles

Medium Priority:
- Add more startup flags
- Make a super simple guide to setting up a bot on a linux server. I was terrible at this once and know how it feels to be lost.

Low Priority:
- Mod Features
- Some kind of remember me so credentials don't have to be added. I'll add this as a flag since remembering credentials is risky and I want it to be an active choice to store that data.
- monit support
- Support for multiple subreddits.
