ModMinion
=========

This is a tool that scans a single subreddit (for now) and will message the mods when specific events happen. These events include when certain users post and when user defined words are found. Approved moderators can also send messages to the account to add new rules. The bot does not require mod privileges. The account relies on messaging to work, so the account the bot uses needs some link karma to work.
